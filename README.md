Finally! This project took me ages to complete compared to all previous projects. While it was certainly difficult and made me want to hit/throw things, I likely learned the most about modern JS so far from this project. Funny how that works. 

Now, I feel much more confident with modules, IIFEs, scope, and all the other fancy things we do to organize code. I also have a better understanding of webpack, using other libraries (eg: date-fns), and using APIs (eg: web storage). Perhaps most importantly, I became a lot better at writing loosely coupled code by using a pubsub library. Without a pubsub module, writing loosely coupled code seems impossible.

One thing I will need to continue to improve upon is debugging. Prior, I had gotten good at using Chrome's debugger; however, the use of multiple modules makes it impossible for me track variables and see what's going on. I had to rely a lot on console.log and the classic trial-and-error. In the future, I will look for ways to incorporate Chrome's debugger into my debugging process again.
